# Weekly report 2

I have started to write code for the project. This far I have written:
- a class representing a node in a trie
- a class representing the trie structure with the following functions:
    - a function that adds a word into the trie
    - a function that searches the trie for a specific word
    - a function that can read a file and add its contents to the trie, and
- tests for these classes and functions.

Other stuff I did this week:
- added configuration, such as using pylint and coverage
- added a list of English words that I used to manually test the trie
  structure I wrote, and
- discussed the project with the teacher.

The project has progressed but there is still a long way to go. Next I will
look into the following tasks:
- the list of English words may not be the one I end up having in the final
  version. I will look for a list that also takes into account the frequency of the words
- start writing the code that calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance
  between words, and
- later I need to write some kind of user interface for the application. It will
  most likely be a simple text-based one. Coding a graphical interface would take time that is better spent writing the algorithm.

Things I am unsure about:
- at the moment, I don't have any bigger questions because I've just had the discussion with
  the teacher.

This week I have spent 4 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 13 hours on the project.
