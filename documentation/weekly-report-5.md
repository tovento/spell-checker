# Weekly report 5

Things I did this week:
- wrote tests for the services
- updated documentation
- peer reviewed other student's project

This week I was not as productive as in the previous weeks. Next week I need to get
back in track with the project.
- Application could return better suggestions
- Tests should be fine-tuned

This week I spent 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 hours on the project.
